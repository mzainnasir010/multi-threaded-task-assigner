# multi-threaded-task-assigner
A C++ simulation project implementing core Operating System concepts such as mutual exclusion, deadlock avoidance, thread synchronization, and Least Recently Used (LRU) scheduling — modeled around a worker-resource task assignment system.

# 🏗️ Worker Task Allocation System in C++

This is a console-based, multi-threaded C++ simulation of a construction site where tasks are assigned to workers based on their proficiency, resource availability, and current weather conditions. It includes deadlock prevention, task prioritization, and worker break management.

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic weather impact on work
- Worker proficiency & break system (LRU-managed)
- Resource allocation and recovery
- Deadlock prevention and retry queue
- Thread-safe operations using `mutex` and `condition_variable`
- Interactive terminal menu

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Concurrency:** thread, mutex, condition_variable, Worker Task Allocation System in C++
- **Data Structures:** vector, list, deque, map
